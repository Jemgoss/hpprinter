# hpprinter

This builds a package for Arch Linux with the bare minimum to support an HP printer (currently just an HP ENVY 5660 AIO printer).
It could easily be modified to install all the ppds for all HP printers.

It basically extracts the essential few bits from hplip without hauling in all its myriad of dependencies and bloat.
